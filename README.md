# SolidResume

**SolidResume** is a work-in-progress Hugo framework for building a **single-page CV** website.  
The goal is to provide a clean, responsive, and printable design that follows modern web standards and produces structured, machine-readable data where appropriate.

> ⚠️ This project is **under active development**. Expect breaking changes, incomplete features, and frequent iterations.

## Key Features (planned)

- **Single page layout** – a concise CV with all key sections
- **Multilingual support** – e.g. English / Norwegian
- **Light / dark mode** – auto-detected + manual toggle
- **Print / PDF support** – export directly via browser’s print to PDF
- **Structured data** – JSON-LD (schema.org/Person) for better SEO and machine readability
- **Modern typography** – clean, readable monospace font stack
- **Responsive design** – works well on desktop and mobile

## Getting Started

```bash
